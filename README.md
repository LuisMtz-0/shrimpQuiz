# shrimpQuiz

## Description 

ShrimpQuiz was created to practice my skill using javaScript and making my website more productive and responsive with future users. \

- Creating ShrimpQuiz was a hard endeavor mostly because of the drive to keep adding more stuff toward the web page and combine tailwind css 
- Thanks to building this project I now have a greater understanding in java usage to change my front website with anything the user requires 
- One of the problems I faced with working on this website was the fact of the bugs that kept appearing due to adding new elements
